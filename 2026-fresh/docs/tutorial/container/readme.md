# Containers & Interfaces – Architectural Foundations

## Overview

This tutorial teaches architectural thinking using a simple PHP CLI project.

You will build a small Notification System step by step.

The goal is not to improve coding speed.
The goal is to understand structure.

This tutorial focuses on:

- Tight coupling
- Interfaces
- Containers
- Extensibility
- Structured AI prompting

You will use AI as a learning assistant — not as a shortcut.

## Who Is This For?

This tutorial is designed for:

- Interns
- Junior developers
- Business analysts exploring development
- Anyone wanting to understand architecture concepts

You do NOT need advanced PHP knowledge.

You only need:
- Basic understanding of classes
- Basic ability to run PHP from the command line

## What This Tutorial Is NOT

This tutorial does NOT teach:

- Frameworks
- Databases
- APIs
- File storage
- Production-level architecture
- Advanced design patterns
- Optimization techniques

We intentionally keep everything simple.

## How This Tutorial Works

You will progress through structured phases:

1. Phase 1 – Hard-Coded Implementation  
2. Phase 2 – Introduce Interface  
3. Phase 3 – Introduce Container  
4. Phase 4 – Extend the System  
5. Challenge Phase  

Each phase builds on the previous one.

You must not skip phases.
